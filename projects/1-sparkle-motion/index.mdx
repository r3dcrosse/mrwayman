# Sparkle Motion

## Overview

[Sparkle Motion](https://github.com/baaahs/sparklemotion) is a tool for controlling and interacting with over 60,000+ LEDs on the [BAAAHS](https://baaahs.org/) Burning Man art car. 

An interface exploring how computation meets light.

:::info

I co-led this massive volunteer effort along with [Christian Williams](https://github.com/xian) and [Tom Seago](https://github.com/tomseago).

My specific contributions include:

- Designed and developed core web UI elements in React.js.
- Developed the initial API Proposal for light shows and contributed commits to pass data to the web front end from the Kotlin back end.
- Designed the LED form factor to use in the panels.

See the [complete list of my commits](https://github.com/baaahs/sparklemotion/commits?author=r3dcrosse) and the [full list of contributors](https://github.com/baaahs/sparklemotion/graphs/contributors).

## Simulator and Web UI

## Web UI for interacting with LEDs

I developed the control panel UI, including the slider components.

## Result

### Panel Mapping

Each LED panel gets mapped relative to its geometry on the 3D model of the art car. Only 1/2 of the panels on the art car get mapped: the driver's side, which contains the DJ booth. [Christian Williams](https://github.com/xian) developed the computer vision mapping feature built into the Sparkle Motion Web UI.

### Test Run

A test run of the first LED light show.

### Happy Partygoers

A crowd of happy partygoers dances as the legendary [Carl Cox](https://carlcox.com/) DJs from the BAAAHS art car. The art car is also a mobile sound system.
