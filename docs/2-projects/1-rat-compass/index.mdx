# Rat Compass

## Overview

It started with this thought:

> What if we made use of color to give us direction? 
> What would that look like?

No, I don't have [Synesthesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synesthesia), but I do have some LEDs, a Magnetometer (Compass) sensor, and a plastic rat skeleton... let's light this thing up and make some art!

**Presenting**: Rat Compass

Let's make it possible to interact with Earth's magnetic field as a colorful, synesthesic experience.
