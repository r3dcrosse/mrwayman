# BAAAHS LED Lights 2019

A revamp of the LED lights on the BAAAHS Burning Man art car.

6-7x more LEDs than the top of San Francisco's SalesForce Tower.

This was a _massive_ group project and wouldn't have been possible without the help of [many people](#full-list-of-credits).

To draw a clear line of my direct contributions:

1. Co-led the project along with [@xian](https://github.com/xian) and [@tomseago](https://github.com/tomseago).
1. Came up with the design for how the LEDs should be placed in each panel.
1. Built Web UI features for the control panel.
1. Provided meeting spaces, set-up/sent-out meeting invites.
