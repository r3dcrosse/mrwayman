# Painting with hashes

Inspired by GitHub's profile avatar feature, I wanted to build a tool that does something similar but with more degrees of freedom to express one's digital presence.

:::tip

Type in a username/handle/name to generate a pixel avatar.

## Future Ideas

- Live performance, a singer's words are fed into the hash painter and projected behind the singer
- Enter a website URL of a website that contains text look up free poems?)
  - Play back the hash painting of the poem
  - Animated, based on the length of words

## Idea 3: Build a UI to "paint" with hashes

- Provide a selector for which hash to use (SHA256, SHA512, etc). This controls the size of canvas
- Provide a couple of sliders to control what variables in HexRow.tsx get placed where
- Add geometric effects to take the produced hash painting and mirror it/make it into something interesting

## Idea 2: Use hex colors for each 6 pixels

<PixelGenerator art={Art.horizontalHexColor} />

<div style={{marginTop:"4rem"}} />

<PixelGenerator art={Art.verticalHexColor} />

<div style={{marginTop:"4rem"}} />

## Idea 1: pixels

<PixelGenerator
  controls={[Controls.blur, Controls.hueRotate]}
  art={Art.pixel}
/>

## Concept

Take a SHA256 hash of a string and map each char to a grid going left to right, top to bottom.

<PixelGenerator art={Art.rawHash} />
