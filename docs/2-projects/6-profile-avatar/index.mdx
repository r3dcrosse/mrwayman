# Profile Avatar

Inspired by GitHub's profile avatar feature, I wanted to build a tool that does something similar but with more degrees of freedom to express one's digital presence.

:::tip

Type in a username/handle/name to generate a pixel avatar.

:::

## Idea 2: Use hex colors for each 6 pixels

<AvatarGenerator art={Art.hexColor} />

## Idea 1: pixels

<AvatarGenerator
  controls={[Controls.blur, Controls.hueRotate]}
  art={Art.pixel}
/>

## Concept

Take a SHA256 hash of a string and map each char to a grid going left to right, top to bottom.

<AvatarGenerator art={Art.rawHash} />
